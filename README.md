## SQL Project with Tableau Dashboard

This GitHub repository hosts a data analysis project that combines SQL queries with a Tableau dashboard to explore road accident data. The project aims to provide insights into accident trends, severity, and contributing factors.

## ðŸ“Œ What's in this repository? 
## SQL Queries
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze road accident data. These queries help extract key insights, such as:

Total number of accidents and casualties
Average number of vehicles involved in accidents
Accident severity categorization
Trends in accidents over the years
Accidents by day of the week and road surface conditions
You can run these queries on your SQL database to perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset.

## Tableau Dashboard
Alongside the SQL queries, this project includes a Tableau dashboard that visualizes the analyzed data. The dashboard presents interactive charts and graphs, making it easier to understand accident patterns and trends.
