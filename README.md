## SQL Project with Power BI Dashboard

This GitHub repository hosts a data analysis project that combines SQL queries with a Power BI dashboard. 
The project aims to provide insights and visualizations based on a dataset related to road accidents. Here's what you'll find in this repository:
 
**SQL Queries:**
You will find a collection of SQL queries in this repository. These queries are designed to extract valuable information from the road accident dataset. You can run these queries on your SQL database to analyze the data.

**Power BI Dashboard:**
Alongside the SQL queries, I have created a Power BI dashboard to visualize the data. 
The dashboard transforms raw data into interactive and informative visuals, making it easier to understand trends, patterns, and key insights related to road accidents.
